Starting from any gas station, assume gas station i is the potential starting point, 
keep track of the volume of our gas tank, if our gas tank is above zero then it means we can go from our chosen starting point
to the current gas station, if the gas tank is below zero, then all points from i to current gas station can not be our starting point.
So we keep going, until we reach the end. The last start we recorded along the way will be our starting point, or if totalGas - totalCost < 0, 
there is no solution.
