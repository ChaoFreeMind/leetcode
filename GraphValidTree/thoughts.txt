According to the hint: 
1. The Graph should be one connected component 2. The graph should not contain cycle

My first attempt used BFS, the trick part of this problem is how to detect cycle. Here I used an array called visited, and there are 3 status during our BFS algorithm: Not visited, Being in the Queue(Being visited) and Completely visited. If there are 2 connected elements in the queue at the same time, it means they have created a cycle!
