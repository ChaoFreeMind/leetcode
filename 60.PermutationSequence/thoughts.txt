First of all, we add numbers from 1 to n into a list and we pick each digit one by one. For the first digit, we can see that for each one of the first digit in all permutation sequences, there are (n-1)! of them, so we are going to decide where k has landed: k/(n-1)! where k is zero-based. After picking this number, we need to update k to k%(n-1)!, and repeat this process until there are no digits left to pick.
