Although the implementation is accepted, you have to see that the numbers may get out of order some time, take 3 4 1 5 as an example, when we see 3, we assign it to first, then we see 4, assign it to the second, however, when we came across 1, our algorithm actually assign it to first which seems to violate the definition of increasing sequence, the reason behind this is that although we find a smaller first, we still got a 3 and 4 as a potential valid sequence, so once we find a number bigger than 4, we get ourself a valid triplet.
