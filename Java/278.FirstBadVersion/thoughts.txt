For this problem, this first solution that comes to my mind is linear search the first bad version we got would be the solution. 
However it is obvious that we could do better with binary search: each time we check the middle version: if the middle version is a bad one, we go left to validate if it is the first bad version; if the middle version is good, then the first bad version must resides in the right half thus we go right.
