Three steps:(Take 1,3,5,4,2 as an example)
First find the biggest index k such that nums[k] < nums[k+1], so from k to the end, the array will be sorted in descending order.

Second, find the biggest index m!=k such that nums[m] > nums[k] and Swap m and k, now that nums[k] < nums[m], and m is the first element bigger than k, thus the array from k+1 to the end will still be in descending order.

Third reverse k+1 to the end.
