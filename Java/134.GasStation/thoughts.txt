2 keys to solve this problem:

1. If the sum of all gas[i] - cost[i] is less than zero, there will not be any solution to this problem.

2. Say we start from A and we run out of gas when we reached C, then gas[C] - cost[C] must be a negative number big enough to counter the all the gas we accumulate from A to C exclusive. Thus, there will not be any potential starting point between A and C.
