This problem is a pain in the ass!
First of all, if you try to iteratively do dividend - divisor you will get TLE. The trick is to use something like binary search. For example we have 27 / 4, what we can do is to shift 4 to the left util it is bigger than 27, which we get 4 << 2 = 16, thus we can subtract (1 << 2) number of divisors from the origin dividend. Now the dividend is 27 - 16 = 11, we keep doing the above actions, first there is a 4 << 1 we can subtract, which allows us 1 << 1 number of divisor being subtracted from the dividend which is 11 - 8 = 3. Current quotient is 1 << 2 + 1 << 1 = 6.
