First think of every situations possible. n=20 [3,5], [1,5] By observation we can see that all those cases can be boiled down to three: If the next number in nums is bigger than covered + 1, then we will apply patch cover + 1, or we could just go ahead and increase the coverage by current num. If we are running out of numbers, we just patch the next missing number which is covered + 1.
