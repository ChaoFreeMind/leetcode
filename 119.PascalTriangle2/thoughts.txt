Use only one list to store the previous row, as we need to update this piece of memory using its previous values, we need to be careful here, for example, if previous row is [1,2,1] when we set arr[i] = arr[i] + arr[i-1], we made the array [1,3,1], but next value should compute based on previous value 2 + 1 not 3 + 1. The solution here is to do this reversely. From the last element in the back to the 2nd element at the front.
