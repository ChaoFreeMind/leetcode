We need to find the mid one or two points of the longest path in the graph. 
First choose a random node say 0, run BFS on it and find out the node V that has the longest distance from node 0, then node V must be one side of the longest path in our graph, run BFS again on V then we can get the longest path from node V say U, finally we only need to return the middle one or two nodes depending on the length of the path is even or odd.


There is easier way to solve this problem!! Check out the discussion
